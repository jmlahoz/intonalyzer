Intonalyzer is a tool designed to transcribe Spanish intonation following ToBI principles.

How to install Intonalyzer as a Praat plugin in a permanent fashion:
1. Go to your Praat options folder.
   On Windows, this is under your user folder.
   For example, press the Windows key + R, type
   %USERPROFILE%\Praat
   and accept.
2. Create a subfolder named plugin_intonalyzer
   (this is case-sensitive).
3. Copy all the Intonalyzer files into that subfolder.
   You are ready to go.
   Next time you open Praat, go to the Praat menu on the objects window and
   you will find the Intonalyzer sub-menu.
